# Lecture_support

These are folders that contain support files (.Rmd, .pdf, .R, etc)
in support of your lectures. Each folder corresponds to a lecture. For
example, 01_L is the first lecture, 02_L and so on. You can upate the
contents of lecture_folder by pulling in the latest updates to it. To
do this, do the following:

Open the "Terminal" tab in the lower left pane. This will open a window
with the "$" prompt. You can then do the following:

```
$ cd lecture_folder 
$ git pull origin main
```
And the files in this folder will be updated.
